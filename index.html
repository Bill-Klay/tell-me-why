            Below are a series of Questions and their respective answers to account for all the queries that must be
            boggling up in your mind, so go ahead grab a cup of whatever is it that you drink and enjoy the read!

            <h3>1. Why did you not include anyone from inside the room where males are restricted?</h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                Hmmmm. At first it wasn't going to be this way. This video which lead you here has been in 
                progress with bit by bit shooting whenever I could get a good random shot of people doing everyday 
                task. And as you may know this was hard to do with any of the girls I know. So, I had specifically 
                planned to arrange a shoot with the help of Sania by giving her my camera and some scenarios. As it 
                turned out it wasn't going to be as easy as I thought it would be. Time went on and we kept on 
                PROcastinating until the time I thought that it would be better to leave it out as is since including 
                them would really violate the policies we have at Qordata and I was already breaching many rules as is.
                Besides this I don't know much people from inside the room, just you and a handful other and I didn't 
                know how others would react to the idea of them being recorded and uploaded to the internet. I hope that
                you understand and can forgive me along with all of other lacking of personality and character in me ðŸ¥º
                It is a very strong belief that we shouldn't interact besides work hence doing somthing like this would go 
                completely againts Qordata's culture and what they stand for, which I really respect.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Wasn't this wrong already?</h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                Yes, I am aware of that and I hold your concern in high regard. This is called leverage. I just wanted to show
                the fun side of Qordata. Many people show their concern that everything is dead here as far as workplace fun
                and pranks are considered. Hence, this sheds some light on the light side of Qordata.

            <h3>3. How's it going? Whats happening these days? Still at Qordata?</h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                Ahhhh, yea. I guess its about time isn't it? I won't lie, but I am looking for opportunities 
                presumably remote, so I'm just waiting for the best time and not rushing it. Besides this times 
                have been strict recently as we're rushing for the final quarter. New product ideas, marketing 
                strategies and competing with new companies. I like the fact that our team gets to explore new 
                horizons with freedom and investment from the company. How about you? I'm sure you're good as 
                always, but what else is new? Any new hobbies? A new place you visited? Still working out and cycling?

            <h3>4. Anything else in the works?</h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                Affirmative. Of course there's always something to do and less time to prioritize it ðŸ˜› Then
                again its never about having enough time to do stuff its all about priorities. Its not about 
                whether you can do something or not its about if you want to?

            <h3>5. How long were you planning this?</h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                The video or this conversation that we're having right now? ðŸ˜… I'll let you know for both. Firstly, 
                I have been planning to make this video project for quite sometime now. It wasn't so hard to make 
                this video, but it took longer to shoot random scenarios and acts that people playout in their day 
                to day life at work. And to make sure that what was happening was interesting to watch and curious 
                as well, thats what took longer to shoot, not the video itself. I guess I had written about this idea 
                in my tiny night thougts notebook back in October last year. Secondly, talking about this conversation 
                that we're having right now. You wouldn't believe the amount of private repositories I have and what I 
                have in them ðŸ˜‹ Well, I have a small sleep cycle, so either I'm up early or sleeping late. 
                Sometimes I dare myself to go to sleep super early and be alone with me night thougts. That's when I 
                guess I had these conversations about you and couple other people questioning my work ðŸ™ƒ I keep a 
                dream notebook at my bedside and write down anything interesting that comes to mind. And I've noticed 
                most of the productive and gripping thougts come to me late night, so I like quite thoughtful nights.

            <h3>6. Did you really have a conversation with me in your mind? </h3>
            <p class="justify-text">
                I don't mean to be weird and come across as a freak to you, but I'm sure everyone has these. Like 
                I said, sometimes I dare myself to go to sleep early and be alone with my thoughts. That's why I really 
                do not mind when people are honest with me even if they think it would offend me. I honestly don't 
                mind anything. Two words I would use to describe myself are 'Apathetic' & 'Stoic'. Instead that's how 
                I would like people to be, this way nothing goes on behind you.
